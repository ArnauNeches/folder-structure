# Folder structure
## Author: Arnau Neches Vilà

Simple program that prints on screen the folder structure of the current directory.
It is implemented in Python. Sorry I didn't know the comand tree existed (rookie mistake).

### Usage:

positional arguments:
 - path             Path to scan (Default ".")

options:
 - -h, --help       show this help message and exit
 - --skip, -s SKIP  Comma-separated list of files/folders to skip
 - -l               Longer indentation
