# Folder structure
## Author: Arnau Neches Vilà

Simple program that prints on screen the folder structure of the current directory.
It is implemented in Python. Sorry I didn't know the comand tree existed (rookie mistake).

Has two parameters:
1. Path: Path from which the trasverse will be done.
2. Skip: List of files/directories which will be skipped. (Useful if you want to ignore folders like .git)
